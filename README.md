# SHAPEAI PYTHON AND NETWORK SECURITY BOOTCAMP



Hi I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by <b> SHAPEAI </b>.

The instructor during the session was Mr. Harsh Akshit  . I got to learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:

<li>Python

<li>Network Security

<br>during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
